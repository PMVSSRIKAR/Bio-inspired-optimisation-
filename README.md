# Bio-inspired-optimisation-
The logic is modified by me, but the  problrem statement and outline is taken from elsewhere 
These are the codes for minimizing the cost by taking optimal MW from different power stations, 
which are having different constraints on minimum and maximum power,impacts from fuel cost and running cost. 
This is a optimisation problem with various constraints solved using bio inspired optimisation.
The codes are all matlab codes.

Techniques used are-
Genetic algorithm,
Particle Swarm Optimisation,
Jaya algorithm,
TLBO algorithm,
Differential evolution
